### SQL + Power BI Coffee Sales Dashboard

This project is part of my data analyst portfolio, where I created a **Coffee Sales Dashboard** using **MySQL** for data handling and **Power BI** for visualization. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends for a coffee shop.

#### Project Details:
- **Data Source**: Sales data imported and cleaned using **MySQL**.
- **Visualization**: Built with **Power BI** to display key metrics such as total sales, revenue trends, top-selling products, and customer purchasing patterns.
- **Objective**: To analyze the coffee shopâ€™s sales data, identify revenue growth opportunities, and improve inventory management.

#### Key Features:
- **Sales Trends**: Track daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance.
- **Top Products**: Visualize best-selling items and low-performing products.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyze purchasing patterns and customer preferences.
- **Inventory Management**: Forecast demand to reduce waste and improve stock levels.

#### Tools Used:
- **MySQL**: Data cleaning and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization.

This project was built with the help of YouTube tutorials, making it a great learning experience for integrating databases with business intelligence tools.
